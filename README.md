## Overview of Election Audit

The purpose of this audit was to observe overall results combined with micro-trends within the election itself.

The primary goal was to determine who the winner of the election was. A secondary purpose served by the audit was to gather demographic details on the voters themselves. This may have implications for where politicians should focus their campaign efforts and initiatives, based on which counties present with higher active voters.

## Summary 
The script is clearly very useful for handling an election where only one electoral district is being analyzed. The script can be expanded to include an if statement to look at electoral districts when analyzing multiple (so that only one script needs to be run, rather than running it several times on separeted sets of data). Furthermore, utilizing a for loop with an integrated if statement that looks at each electoral district will allow us to analyze results per district. This therefore, can generate winning statistics for each separate district under questions.
